# Infinite Class Field Towers
The cover image for the post is an AI generated interpretation of an 'infinite class field tower'. Infinite class field towers are not tangible objects, so the generate image is abstract but looked interesting so I used it. Unless you're a number theorist, you've probably never heard of a class field tower, so what are these and why would it matter if they are finite or infinite?

Before going further, I'll warn you that this post gets progressively more advanced mathematically. To avoid getting lost in the details, here is the main idea: unique factorization into primes doesn't always happen and when you try to fix this you may introduce additional factorization issues, so you fix those, and so on forming what is called a Class Field Tower. Depending on the structure of the place you started the tower, the process may stop and you solve all the unique factorization problems giving a finite tower. If your starting field has the 'right' structure though, the process will never end forming an infinite tower.

For a little history, the failure of unique factorization was realized in the late 1700's and by the early 1900's most of 'Class Field Theory' had been developed to handle the problem but many believed the process of forming class field towers was always finite until Golomb and Shafarevich showed relatively simple criteria that would force infinite class field towers to occur.
